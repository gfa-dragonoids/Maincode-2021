/**
 * This file contains an example of an iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode". An OpMode is a 'program'
 * that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match. The names of OpModes
 * appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station. When an selection is made from the menu, the
 * corresponding OpMode class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * <p>This particular OpMode just executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a two wheeled robot It
 * includes all the skeletal structure that all iterative OpModes contain.
 *
 * <p>Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new
 * name. Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode
 * list
